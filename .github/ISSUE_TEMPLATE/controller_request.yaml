        This template is for requesting support for new controllers. Please search the issue tracker for existing open issues, and check the list of [supported controllers](https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControl#supported-controllers) before opening a new controller request. If your controller is on the list but not behaving correctly, a bug report may be more appropriate.

        With no other bluetooth controllers connected, either screenshot or note down the numeric input displayed as you press each button on the controller one-by-one. Do the same for the Â±X/Y positions of the analog sticks and post your results here.
